# Vector-Test
A small demo to test my Vector class. Might add comments in the future.

If you pay close attention, you can guess what I coded last by my code getting more and more messy.

### Controlls:

  W/Arrow Up -> Rotates by 1°/tick

  S/Arrow Down -> Rotates by -1°/tick

  R -> Lets you rotate by a specific amount
  
  Left Click -> Point moves to your Mouse
